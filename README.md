Gym Rat

Description: The Gym Rat App is a one stop shop for all of your gym needs and motivates the users to live a healthy lifestyle. Navigating through the app a user will be able to find their nearest gym locations, search and find new music to work out to, the weather in their current location; in case they want to go for a run. Workout videos for at home or in the gym; to exclude the need for a personal trainer, and healthy recipes to cook at home. We also added a feature to find workout buddies near each other, so you can meet new people and reach your fitness goals together.

Motivation: There are hundreds of apps in the market that only deliver one or two things to the customer. We have our phones filled with many fitness, meals and music appsâ€¦ So we thought why not combine all into one solid application that can do ALL of those things at the palm of your hand.

Results: Using JavaScript, YouTube iFRAME, Google Maps API, iTunes API, Food2Fork API, Weather Map API, & Firebase to store users. Our application is able to find you a great restaurant via your zip code, local gyms, learn new workout videos and play music within one single application. 

Team Efforts: Work was delegated by the amount of APIs we were using. Each one of us was responsible for an API along with any HTML, CSS and JavaScript required. 

Individual Responsibilities: As a group we decided on a UI desigh. Rion in charge of YouTube API . Arnab added special effects to the UI, along with Google Maps API, Weather API. Rigo in charge of Music API. Everyone was responsible for their share of HTML, CSS and JS.

Challenges: Most of our challenges came with finding free APIs that had good and clear documentation. Another challenge was being able to push, pull and merge.

Improvements: In the future we would like to be able to create playlist of the music and videos. Create a chat room for users to schedule gym sessions. Search through youtube video, and create profiles to keep tract of their "Gym Rat buddies"
